README for herzi's mango-lassi
==============================

THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL REPOSITORY

This repository is created to do some development on Mango Lassi (which was
originally written by Lennart Pöttering). He asked me to simply fork his
project to apply the changes I'm considering to add.

When he does a review of the code here, he'll decide whether to merge my
changes or whether to update the web references to guide people to this
repository as the official one.

Changes made in this tree:
 * added the patches from mango-lassi.sf.net (to fix some crashes and implement
   screen reordering)
 * add a menu item and a logo
 * be less verbose on the console (unless --verbose gets passed)
 * improved OSD overlays (only the background is transparent, the text and icon
   are opaque -- unless no RGBA colormap is available, then the display is the
   same)
